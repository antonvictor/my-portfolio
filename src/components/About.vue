    <h1>Hi, I’m Anton!</h1>
    <p>I’m a former pharmacist transitioning into the world of web development. I specialize in front-end work using Vue.js and React, and I’m on my way to becoming a full-stack developer. I enjoy creating intuitive, responsive websites and am always eager to learn new tech. Outside of coding, I love keeping up with the latest trends and enjoying a good coffee break. Let’s connect and build something awesome!</p>
